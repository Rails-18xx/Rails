<big>Operating round: #OR#</big><br>

#BUY_PRIVATES#

<br><br><b>Tile laying</b> proceeds as follows:
<br><br> 1. On the map, select the hex that you want to lay a new tile upon.
<br>If tile laying is allowed on this hex, the current tile will shrink a bit
<br>and a red background will show up around its edges;
<br>in addition, the tiles that can be laid on that hex will be displayed
<br> in the 'upgrade panel' at the left hand side of the map.
<br>If tile laying is not allowed there, nothing will happen.
<br><br> 2. Select a tile in the upgrade panel.
<br>This tile will be copied to the selected hex, in some orientation
<br><br> 3. If you want to turn the tile just laid to a different orientation, click it.
<br>Repeatedly clicking the tile will rotate it through all allowed orientations.
<br><br> 4. Confirm tile laying by clicking 'Done'
<br><br>Before 'Done' has been pressed, you can change your mind
<br>as often as you want (presuming that the other players don't get angry).
<br> - If you want to select another hex: repeat step 1
<br> - If you want to lay another tile on the currently selected hex: repeat step 2.
<br> - If you want to undo hex selection: click outside of the map hexes.
<br> - If you don't want to lay a tile after all: press 'Cancel'
