Rails has been developed by:

Erik Vos
Brett Lentz
Mark Smith

With contributions from:
Iain Adams
Freek Dijkstra

Portions of Rails have come from Colossus ( http://colossus.sourceforge.net ), 
a clone of the Titan board game. The members of the Rails project would like to 
thank David Ripton and all of the authors of Colossus for making a wonderful 
game and allowing it to be distributed under the GPL.

Rails would also like to thank the following people for their contributions to 
the 18xx gaming genre. Without them, there would be no Rails:

Francis Tresham
Bill Dixon
John David Galt
David Hecht
John Tamplin

We would also like to acknowledge Simtex and their electronic version of 1830. It 
has been the source of much inspiration.
