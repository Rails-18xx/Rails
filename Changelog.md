# Rails-18xx 2.4.5 Release
This release is meant to show the current state of the Rails-18xx implementation.

Due to different reasons Rails-18xx 2.0 and 2.1 have not been release as production releases. We hope that the audience
finds the release usefull. As usual we welcome bug reports and save games that show the affected states of the game.

We would like to **thank** the various bug reporters and the developers who have contributed over the years for one
feature or ground breaking work.
Please take note that to run Rails-18xx as a JAR directly you need to install a JDK with Java V11 as minimum. The game comes with its own JRE compiled in.

Please dont use the .bat from earlier versions.

**Using the installer on Windows and the same directory as previous installations, will overwrite everything in that directory.**

We would like to **thank** the varios bug reporters and the developers who have contributed over the years for one feature or ground breaking work.
