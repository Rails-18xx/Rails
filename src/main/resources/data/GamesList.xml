  <Game name="1825">
    <Note>Not yet playable</Note>
    <Description>1825 Unit 1
(c) 1994 Hartland Trefoil Ltd.
Designed by Francis Tresham

Known Issues:
- change the formationOrderIndex from an Integer variable to an IntegerState variable
- BUG: prompt on placing GWR token when upgrading London, needs investigation
- BUG: Trains do not have to own a train and directors cannot fund the purchase of one
- Tile lays that send track off the board are legal in 1825 as long as they don't run into the
	 sea or the edge of a pre-placed tile with no track on.  Currently Rails will not allow some
	 of these edge placements.  The workaround is to use map correction mode to place the tile you want.
	 ADDITIONAL NOTE: Map correction might still not work, I think route awareness is confused by track going out of the board...
	 We might need a different fix
- Upgrades to pre-printed tiles are lays, not promotions so you are allowed two of these in a turn.
  Rails currently only allows you to lay 2 yellow tiles in a turn. Again, use map correction
  for a workaround
- The rule about the two tiles place on your turn not being adjacent is currently not enforced by rails
	and must be enforced manually by players
- Revenue Calc: Routes BEGIN and END with large stations, this is currently not checked
- Revenue Calc: Trains may not visit two stations on the same tile, this is currently not checked
- Revenue Calc: 2 2T's can be double headed as a 3T
- The minimum ¬£10 for a train purchase between companies is not enforced
- Money: The boardgame uses company credits, rails does not, as such the bank will potentially break slightly earlier
- Game currently doesn't end when a company reaches the top of the stock market
	It needs to end at the end of that companies turn.
- Hexags reserved for certain companies (currently not enforced in EU either)
- Corps that reach the top of the market should end the game at the end of that corps turn
- Not implemented: selling privates back to the bank
- Not implemented: receivership
